# MessageFormat Working Group

Welcome to the home page for the MessageFormat Working Group, a subgroup of the [Unicode CLDR-TC](https://cldr.unicode.org).

## Charter

The MessageFormat Working Group (MFWG) is tasked with developing and supporting an industry standard
for the representation of localizable message strings. 
MessageFormat is designed to support software developers, translators, and end users with fluent messages
and locally-adapted presentation for data values
while providing a framework for increasingly complex features, such as gender, inflections, and speech. 
Our goal is to provide an interoperable syntax, message data model, and associated processing that is
capable of being adopted by any presentation framework or programming environement.

## MessageFormat 2

The [MessageFormat 2 specification](./spec/) has been approved by the CLDR Technical Committee
and is now a stable part of
the [LDML](https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/) specification.
It is now recommended for implementation and adoption.

Some _default functions_ and items in the `u:` namespace are still in Draft status.
Feedback from users and implementers might result in changes to these capabilities.

The MessageFormat Working Group and CLDR Technical Committee welcome any and all feedback, 
including bugs reports, 
implementation reports, 
success stories, 
feature requests, 
requests for clarification, 
or anything that would be helpful in supporting or enhancing the specification and
promoting widespread adoption.

## Sharing Feedback

Do you have feedback on the specification or any of its elements? [file an issue here](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/new?labels=Preview-Feedback&projects=&template=tech-preview-feedback.md&title=%5BFEEDBACK%5D+)

We invite feedback about implementation difficulties, 
proposed functions or options
real-life use-cases, 
requirements for future work, 
tooling, 
runtime APIs, 
localization workflows, 
and other topics.

- General questions and thoughts → [post a discussion thread](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/discussions).
- Actionable feedback (bugs, feature requests) → [file a new issue](https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues).
