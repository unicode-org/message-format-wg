## MessageFormat 2.0 Unicode Namespace

The `u:` _namespace_ is reserved for the definition of _options_
which affect the _function context_ of the specific _expressions_
in which they appear,
or for the definition of _options_ that are universally applicable
rather than function-specific.
It might also be used to define _functions_ in a future release.

The CLDR Technical Committee of the Unicode Consortium
manages the specification for this namespace, hence the _namespace_ `u:`.

### Unicode Namespace Options

This section describes common **_<dfn>`u:` options</dfn>_** which each implementation SHOULD support
for all _functions_ and _markup_.

#### `u:id`

A string value that is included as an `id` or other suitable value
in the formatted parts for the _placeholder_,
or any other structured formatted results.

Ignored when formatting a message to a string.

The value of the `u:id` _option_ MUST be a _literal_ or a
_variable_ whose _resolved value_ is either a string
or can be resolved to a string without error.
For other values, a _Bad Option_ error is emitted
and the `u:id` option is ignored.

#### `u:locale`

Replaces the _locale_ defined in the _function context_ for this _expression_.

A comma-delimited list consisting of
well-formed [BCP 47](https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/bcp/bcp47.txt)
language tags,
or an implementation-defined list of such tags.

If this _option_ is set on _markup_, a _Bad Option_ error is emitted
and the value of the `u:locale` _option_ is ignored.

During processing, the `u:locale` _option_
MUST be removed from the resolved mapping of _options_
before calling the _function handler_.

Values matching the following ABNF are always accepted:
```abnf
u-locale-option = unicode_bcp47_locale_id *(o "," o unicode_bcp47_locale_id)
```
using `unicode_bcp47_locale_id` as defined for
[Unicode Locale Identifier](https://unicode.org/reports/tr35/tr35.html#unicode_bcp47_locale_id).

Implementations MAY support additional language tags,
such as private-use or grandfathered tags,
or tags using `_` instead of `-` as a separator.
When the value of `u:locale` is set by a _variable_,
implementations MAY support non-string values otherwise representing locales.

Implementations MAY emit a _Bad Option_ error
and MAY ignore the value of the `u:locale` _option_ as a whole
or any of the entries in the list of language tags.
This might be because the locale specified is not supported
or because the language tag is not well-formed,
not valid, or some other reason.

#### `u:dir`

Replaces the base directionality defined in
the _function context_ for this _expression_
and applies bidirectional isolation to it.

If this option is set on _markup_, a _Bad Option_ error is emitted
and the value of the `u:dir` option is ignored.

During processing, the `u:dir` option
MUST be removed from the resolved mapping of _options_
before calling the _function handler_.
Its value is retained in the _resolved value_ of the _expression_.

The value of the `u:dir` _option_ MUST be one of the following _literal_ values
or a _variable_ whose _resolved value_ is one of these _literals_:
- `ltr`: left-to-right directionality
- `rtl`: right-to-left directionality
- `auto`: directionality determined from _expression_ contents
- `inherit` (default): directionality inherited from the _message_
   or from the _resolved value_ of the _operand_ without
   requiring isolation of the _expression_ value.

For other values, a _Bad Option_ error is emitted
and the value of the `u:dir` option is ignored.
