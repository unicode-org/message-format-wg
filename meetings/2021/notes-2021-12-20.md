EAO : Presenting [Slides]()
 
RCA: isn’t this similar to discussion we had re: functions?

EAO: it could be similar to Display Elements/Attributes…as seen on slide, Function References could have named & positional arguments

RCA: for HTML, you need serialization, but for other languages we should worry about security?

EAO: yes, similar to function references

MIH: We agreed that what is presented would be reviewable in advance…I never got a link to these slides…?

EAO: it’s shared on the Github issue, and most of the content is in the design doc

RCA: let’s try to send these out in advance

RCA: I have a question, what are the next steps?

EAO: could have preliminary consensus on these things?

MIH: a lot of these things are presented as “things we identified” but it’s not clear who “we” is, there seems to be a bigger jump here…for example how do I get from a date to a string without a formatting function or options? does it mean that I can’t represent a date in anything but 1 way…?

EAO: interesting question, the design doc doesn’t attempt to answer this

MIH: I’d like to see specific use cases

EAO: Are you questioning variable references without formatting options?

MIH: yes

EAO: the utility is that you can represent, in the data model, a literal part plus a variable reference, plus literal parts

MIH: how do I get from that to a full string? how does it work? how would I do dates?

EAO: this is beyond the scope of this design document, but if we get an input value like a date or number, we should be able to wrap it in some wrapper, like “formattable”, which allows one to “stringify” the date in a locale-appropriate manner…once we get to a formatting part, then 

MIH: isn’t a “formattable thing” a function in the end?

EAO: it’s a wrapper around an object

STA: things that allow things to be extended have big strategic implications for the standard…we could end up with pattern elements that are part of some custom extensions, or future/forward-compatible versions, not a vote “against” or “for”

EAO: two thoughts on this: I would like to handle extensions similar to how XLIFF 2 does modular extensions, which are part of the spec and have to go through a similar process, this could be done in a way that still has some standardization/control…but if we don’t allow for extension and someone has a need to do something, people adding new pattern elements would be less disruptive than other ways of going around the standard

STA: we’ve talked in the past about how L10n industry is slow to adopt innovation, and I’m considering a tradeoff where the next ~20 years of a standard that has 90% coverage but doesn’t cover all use cases might be better than something that’s fragmented but extensible? I don’t have a good answer to what strategy we should have

STA: for variable reference without formatting options is contentious, since MIH wants something more similar to MF1…we could cross that out and achieve everything with function references, for now? we could accept that the initial set has only literal values, function references, and message references, not as a long-term solution but to unblock ourselves

STA: I have an issue with runtime access, not with its merits but vocabulary → we haven’t defined what “without runtime context access” means, especially “context”, I think this means that a function can’t resolve another message but there’s bound to be some context like what locale we’re working with, maybe some other wording would be more appropriate?

EAO: by “runtime context” I mean access to formatting & current locale, see “Elements for Consideration” slide…but agree that wordign could be improved

STA: when you say “without runtime context access” do you mean without the things on the “Elements for Consideration” slide?

EAO: pattern element formatter for function references would have access to formatting, other functions, and current locale, but then pass those on…

STA: the definition of 1 function can call another function?

EAO: if it’s available other than being provided by the pattern element formatter yes, but the pattern element formatter wouldn’t have it itself

ZBI: something I was trying to capture in my design doc comments, maybe I should prepare a slide deck on this…

ZBI: the rethinking of my mental model has been growing over the year: I believe we are not trying to build a system that produces a string, we are building a system that produces a semantic list of parts of a message, and it’s only an artifact that it can be stringified

ZBI: I remember some time ago that “no, we don’t have to produce a string”, I think we’re producing a list of parts, so there’s a value in producing a list of 3 parts, literal/date/literal, even if we don’t know how to stringify it, since unless we are producing a string (which is only 1 side effect)  we might want to give a set of these to give to React, DOM, Android, etc and then the system might show it in its own way (e.g. in a rich UI clock of a date)

ZBI: what we currently call “formattable”, I might call “stringifyable”, this might be useful only when you want to product a string, which is a side effect, so to answer MIH’s question about “how are you going ot stringify a date without formatting information?” I might not be able to stringify it, similar to if you get a rich user object, you should be able to return parts like literal/object/literal…so stringification is outside the scope of this conversation, MIH says “eventually we have to stringify” but there’s a value to MF to format into parts…then you can ask a question “how do you stringify” and that would be a separate design doc…we might even mandate that people add a stringification method, but I don’t think it’s the only/main/default use case of this system

DAF: I wanted to clarify/qualify XLIFF 2’s control of extensions: it has control of its modules, which are an extensibility method for core XLIFF…XLIFF is just XML so you don’t need to think too abstractly, modules are extensions but you can demote them to “extension status”, without breaking core compatibility

EAO: sorry I misspoke, I meant modules

DAF: 2010 architecture was that extensions could be promoted to modules, but if some modules act weirdly, they can be demoted to extensions, and both have happened!

MIH: the trouble with XLIFF is that modules end up in the spec, but nothing requires L10n vendors to add these modules…so if we say “we’ll add this later”, it doesn’t break the spec, but it provides a way to create incompatible versions of the spec in the future

DAF: modules need to be modular so they can be added in/taken out

MIH: agreed.

MIH: on “Possible solutions” slide, solution 3 allows extensions, my solution was that message references would also be functions, so “everything can be implemented as a function.”

MIH: what about “use shorter strings” or “user is a male or female” or “landscape vs. portrait”, these all seem like runtime contexts, are they, and if they are, how can we do this without …also many terms are not defined

MIH: I agree with ZBI that we should be able to return something that’s not a string, but I disagree that we don’t need to worry about it until later, since eventually we’ll end up with a data model in memory and then you still have to tell that thing how to format the date (e.g. “don’t show the time part”), even if you pass it to the DOM and say “somebody else is going to render it”, you still need a way to give instructions about how to render it

EAO: if I’ve understood correctly, you concern is that the recommendation says “without formatting options”, if it’s at the top level of a resolved message, it may not be defined…but on this slide it doesn’t say that these pattern elements shoudl be usable direclty in the message body, this is defining the whole set of pattern elements, but separately we might decide what goes into the message *body*. For example, a variable reference could be placed directly in a message body, or might always need a formatting function reference

MIH: what bothers me is that we take a chunk of something from the middle and we don’t give what’s before and after, for example what the data model is before/after processing…? this isn’t in the original message, it’s after some processing, then we don’t show the final endpoint, and then say “I think these pieces are required”

RCA: I think we should go through the doc again, address some of the concerns

LHS:  Mihai it sounds like you're asking for an end-to-end example or two? (from "translation"/"localized message" to final user display)

MIH: I’m looking for a big-picture design doc, it’s hard to give feedback on this design doc without the context, like seeing the middle of a movie but not the beginning or end

ZBI: I agree that it should be drafted, but probably in a separate design doc, like one for “formatting”

MIH: I don’t care if it’s in a separate document but I can’t judge this without seeing that part

ZBI: I don’t think the 24 hour clock should be in the L10n mechanism, the UI toolkit might have a separate thing that separates analog from digital, including locale preferences, and much of this is independent of L10n

MIH: I agree, you can take Windows/Android/etc and say “from here to here is a date object”, and the TTS will ignore the text part (that might write “2/22/2022”) and read the date based on the object (e.g. it will read “February 22nd, 2022”), but I think we need both

RCA: should we focus on this end-to-end process doc…?

EAO: what I’m hearing here is a need for design doc on message resolution & formatting, I can volunteer to do this with help from others

MIH: I think this should not be a design document, a design document is about “look at alternatives, discuss pros and cons”, what I think this should be is more of a “my vision for this model”, not looking at alternatives, “for pattern elements to work, here’s how it would work”, I think a design doc may be too much

RCA: volunteers?

EAO: I’ll do it (will open an issue)


 
[Separate discussion over chat:]

LHS: Am I correct in assuming that the "Variable Reference without formatting options" would be useful for things like placeholders that ~never need formatting/inflection, versus dates (which arguably need formatting)?

ZBI: Luke - this is one use case I see, yeah.
[`LITERAL`, MESSAGE_REFERENCE("key2"), "LITERAL2"] - the `MESSAGE_REFERENCE("key2") will produce a string and you'll end up with 3 strings that get concatenated.
or `VARIABLE("userName") which is also a string
but I think there's a bigger reason that I'd like to bring up in verbal

LHS: I think in practice ~most placeholders (at least at Google) don't currently require any formatting but are we confident that they'll never need inflection? (I'm thinking things like "userName" that might need it for Slavic languages...)

MIH: The trouble is for types that don't have a clear string representation
Hello {user}
if user is an object of type Person, with first/last name, date of birth, etc

ZBI: if it requiers inflection, it shouldn't be brought via variable directly, but rather some form of `FORMATTING_FUNCTION("declense", VARIABLE("userName"))`

MIH: how do you go from there to "Steve" without a function, or parameters saying "use polite form"
 
 
### Conclusion
 
Before we move further into a decision about this topic we will create a document that shows all the e2e process of runtime and how this proposal fits in. That way we can have a more global picture about the environment.
 
[ ] AP : Create issue and document about the runtime e2e workflow
 
 
# ECMA-402 Proposal Stage 1 #213 - Choose a "Champion" 

RCA: Anyone willing to represent the group of ECMA-402?

EAO: I volunteer

Conclusion

Champions are EAO and DLM , in the next plenary meeting we will ask if someone wants to be co-champion of this proposal. 

RGN its a possible reviewer on the ECMA-402

[ ] AP : Create issue to track the Proposal process
 
# Case Selection - Design Document #208 

MIH: I’m not sure what the goal is, is this group sufficient to make decisions? Design doc was shared a while ago…we don’t have representation from folks like George, Nicolas, etc. Right now we have a narrow representation (mostly from 2 companies), I don’t think we have enough diversity of representation. That being said, I’m open to talk about it (just not vote on it)

RCA: we have ~40 minutes for this topic

EAO: I think we can talk about this, and at least get a “preliminary consensus” or whatever we want to call it, if need be we can present asynchronously to others, and give them time to participate in this process (even if they can’t join the synchronous meeting), I don’t want to block on some “quorum” example

MIH: I’m pessimistic about achieving consensus, but we can go ahead…I’m not sure how to go about this, a few days ago EAO started a slide deck to summarize the design doc, I didn’t think it summarized it, although in fairness I don’t think I could summarize it in 6 slides either…did everyone spend time reading the design document?

EAO: FYI my slides are not designed to summarize the design document, instead they’re my own notes on the problem

MIH: OK, sounds good to me, just understand that it’s separate from the design document

EAO: presents slides

MIH: these slides look different from the last time I saw them, I’d prefer to see them ahead of time

EAO: I’m not asking for judgment calls, but I’m presenting some thoughts

STA: I think of this more as a “comment on the design doc”...we’ve never talked about compatibility strategy before, but another concern might be enclosing messages? I think this is crucial → need to consider 2-directional communication between formatting functions and their enclosing messages…MIH also has an example of where we want to greet a user but don’t have the vocative version of their name, in which case we might use something generic (perhaps not using their name)

MIH: this can be encoded in the metadata

STA: one takeaway I have is that going for the MF1-like solution like “other” flattens the semantics of whether this was intended or not, it’s just a variant that was selected

MIH: I think specifying the fallback at the top would work, I don’t think that’s the issue…but for it to work, I think it requires more work (there’s more runtime metadata, the XLIFF won’t match the “real message”), and it might counteract “good practices” (e.g. for switch-like constructions it’s a good programming practice to have a catch-all)

EAO: Mostly in response to STA, when selection “fails”, I would like to point out that we have a wide scale of how such a fallback might work…it might be expected, but there is a possible middle ground: let’s say you know “this bit is in nominative”, you could use this enriched representation to feed into a system that does improvements on the method, so maybe not a “fail” or “pass”, but you might know it was a fallback

MIH: if there’s a mandatory default, it doesn’t mean that you lose metadata…

EAO: there are just interesting things that can be done with the metadata

STA: do we actually need default selection? with good tooling, metadata, etc. could we just “fail” if someone asks for a variant that doesn’t exist? could we prevent these callsites?

ZBI: what does “failure” look like?

STA: could be a null, error, sentinel? calling code might know there was a data error…happens in the outer message

STA: take plurals for example, we don’t need default fallback on plurals

EAO: I agree with STA, there should be examples where a message fails and the calling function handles the rest

LHS: STA are you arguing that we *never* need a default selection or that it shouldn't be *required*?

STA: I’m trying to convince myself that we never need it…but I don’t know if I’m convinced!

MIH: it’s not “I failed and have no clue”, for example Polish does reach OTHER for decimal numbers, and you might think that you don’t have decimals, and you might end up with them eventually…but plural is a somewhat special case (and arguably badly designed!), since “OTHER” is a specific thing, it’s not “we don’t know”

MIH: if I have to know the gender of an object, it’s unlikely that I’ll always know…I agree that we could tag something as an error and handle it later, but at some point as ZBI mentions “what will my grandma see?”, it’s nice to have a backup, a string from the translator

STA: I don’t mean that we’d propagate the error back to the user, instead in the translation layer, the message that wanted a vocative response might apply its special variant for handling the error…as long as we can tell there was an error in resolving some reference, then the enclosing message can say “use this other variant”

LHS (on chat): It sounds like there are valid use cases for where we do want an in-message default, but there are also valid use cases for "send an error and other parts of the L10n system determine the fallback"...?
...which sounds to me like an argument for allowing defaults but not requiring them...?

RCA: I don’t think the default should be mandatory

EAO: sometimes we do want to fail, and sometimes we want to get “some message out there”

ZIB: in 4 days, ad hoc meeting in Warsaw?

RCA: I want to wrap things up…it’s almost 3 years, time flies

EAO: more like 2 years for the WG

RCA: was useful to get some action points for the next meeting
