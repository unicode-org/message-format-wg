# MessageFormat Subcommittee Agenda

This is the agenda document for upcoming calls of the MessageFormat subcommittee. We normally meet bi-weekly 
(every two weeks) on Mondays at 9:30 Pacific (`America/Los_Angeles`). This is currently UTC+8. 

This will become UTC+7 before the following call slated for 2023-02-13. Since the USA switches to Daylight/Summer time before most other countries, this may affect the wall time of this call for you.

See [here](https://www.timeanddate.com/worldclock/converter.html?iso=20230123T173000&p1=224&p2=248&p3=136&p4=179&p5=33&p6=101&p7=268) for your local time.

Information on joining calls is found in the calendar invite.
