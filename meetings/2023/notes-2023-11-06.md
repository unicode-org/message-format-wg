## Topic: Agenda Review

## Topic: Info Share

APP: I will post the link to the UTW slides, presenting tomorrow.

## Topic: Action Item Review

~APP: balloting for patterns~

## Topic: Undelimited Patterns Decision

Discussion of balloting results:

https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/505
https://github.com/unicode-org/message-format-wg/issues/507

```
Round #1:

3 candidates and 20 ballots.

Number of first votes per candidate:
"1 Always quote": 11
"3 Permit quote": 5
"4 Quote whitespace": 4

"1 Always quote" has the highest number of votes with 11 votes (55.00%)
"4 Quote whitespace" has the lowest number of votes with 4 votes (20.00%)

"1 Always quote" won!
```

RGN: No issue with the syntax as such, but I have a concern about the unquoted simple messages. Concern about the trimming and the classification. Iteration hazard: if you want to add a declaration to a simple message, you need to also quote the pattern.

ECH: Does the pre-Seville syntax address these concerns?

RGN: I think it does, because the pattern was always quoted.

APP: I plan to get feedback at UTW about the trimming expectations of simple patterns.

STA: Filed an issue, maybe #512. Write a doc about text first mode. We replaced the doc we had. Now we don’t have the start-in-text-mode doc. Good to document. We discussed many reasons for both ways. 

ACTION: STA: resurrect the text mode doc

STA: always wrapping simple patterns would make clear what escapes etc to use. Optimizes for near future. Far future would…

## Topic: Beautification of the Syntax

_Having decided the above, changes to remove uglification of the syntax._

APP: Mostly has to do with the whole-message delimiter. Currently: `{{` … `}}`. Alternatives: # as a complex message introducer, or as a keyword sigil.

STA: started liking double `{{` for patterns at least (addison +1). Focus on the outer delimiter.

USA: `{{` is the closest to `{` we can be without being `{`. Agree that it's nice that it's different, but still a lot of braces, and still an educational hazard.

APP: In the course of writing messages and slides about messages, I've taken to like `{{` for patterns. Also found it easier to explain our syntax.

ECH: Shane supported `#` as the complex message introducer.

ECH: No strong opinion here. The primary audience are developers; I assume they will figure out this part of the syntax.

APP: I don't hate `{{` as message openers, but I'm not happy about `}}` at the end. We could either do a single code-introducer, double-char code-introducer, or add a sigil to all keywords.

MIH: Main concern about `#`: has to be escaped. Also, can be confused with a comment. With `}}`, we can imagine stuff coming after it, too.

STA: To start from the last point of MIH we could also put those annotations and comments before the close. That’s one of the reasons we had that, to know where the variants end. Unless you mean that some sort of comments or annotations that are not part of the message format at all, like if I put `//` see comment after, why would I do that in the string literal

STA: I liked APP's callout about what should happen with text outside complex message delimiters. `Hello {{local $foo = {$bar} {{hello}}}}` <- this is a simple (broken) message  

## Topic: Active PR review
Discussion of active PRs. We will merge or reject them in the call.

### #463

MIH: It's not how ICU does it, and I'm concerned that it would be difficult for ICU to be compliant.

MIH: It also doesn't allow overlapping/nested parts. (AttributedString style)

ACTION: MIH to comment on the PR. 

### #502

STA: Jumping to an implementation PR was a bit premature. Let's discuss in the issue or a design doc.

### #475

APP: Will need to address the feedback about the std namespace. Plan: the anonymous namespace is the std namespace.

### #399

STA: Can we hold 

### #470

APP: The current design document doesn’t reflect the discussions of alternatives considered, pros and cons, and how to handle HTML.

STA: The consensus reflects how arguments, etc. are handled, formatting to parts, but not the syntax itself, including the 3 sigils, which I would like to discuss.

APP: Let's land as proposed.

### #501

APP: Let's add an appendix with the non-7405 compatible keyword definitions.

## Topic: AOB?

STA: I started a Github discussion about expression attributes, even though we typically use issues. The PR I originally had the comments in a PR, but it went away. Maybe we can discuss before or during next week’s meeting? I will convert the discussion about open/close into a PR.

APP: I think we should go back as a group and discuss expression attributes. When it was just “locale” and “dir”, I was marginally okay. But EAO’s proposal adds a lot of attributes, and we should use namespacing, similar to XLIFF. I think we should push to not include this in MF2.

MIH: +1

TIM: Did you say you did not want to include attributes in MF2?

APP: Yes, we should focus on finishing outstanding issues like registry, syntax, etc., and getting an implementation done.

STA: Will MIH and ECH take a look, since the EM proposal included a mention

MIH: I don’t feel strongly about these attributes being in the placeholders themselves. I think they are called “semantic comments” here.

APP: And that’s out of scope.

MIH: Yes, it’s out of scope.

APP: And maybe tooling can handle these outside of the patterns, and/or do something inspired by ITS syntax (?)
