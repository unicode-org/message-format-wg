NOTES: 




## Schedule and Goals for 2023
Widespread agreement to strive for a separate UTR/UTS.
Aiming for some level of completeness in June for the 16.0 release is an aggressive, but viable target.


## Keywords and normative vocabulary
APP: I’m fine with RFC 2119 terms for normativity, but Mark Davis doesn’t like them. Unicode documents normally embed explicit numbered requirements.
APP: Additionally, our text is probably not sufficiently stable to count on ordering.
RGN: Examples of Unicode style at https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr31/#Conformance and https://www.unicode.org/reports/tr35/#11-conformance 
EAO: Preference for 2119; Unicode style would be cumbersome at this point but we can always add numbers later.
APP: objections? [none]
EAO: Do we want to style the keywords?
[relatively even split between caps vs. formatting, with many “don’t care” opinions]
### Conclusion
No objection to 2119 keywords. APP to add text adopting them, capitalizing the terms.
For internal terms, bold+italicize on first use and italicize references.


## Function Registry
STA:

Mihai: here are some examples from my current proposal as examples https://github.com/unicode-org/icu/tree/main/icu4j/main/tests/core/src/com/ibm/icu/dev/test/message2






APP: On the topic of syntax, I really hope that we don’t have too many variations and dialects of the MF 2 syntax. It would make it much harder to explain to new users.


MIH: On the topic of syntax, I am in the camp of APP that one of the big benefits of having the MF 2 standard is that the result will be interoperable across the industry.


SCL: On the topic of syntax, we should consider the ability for machine translation systems to properly parse MF 2 messages.
