EAO: This might be useful for generating the rules in a format that’s potentially usable as a basis for linting and validating in particular the default functions and options of MF2.

## Student work on MF2 at UiB

MBH: Programme just starting, with 7 students implementing MF2 support in React, Svelte, and Angular. A preliminary review of pre-existing solutions is available, “UiB \- Overview of localization support in frameworks”
