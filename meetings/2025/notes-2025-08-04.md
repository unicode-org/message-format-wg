Rather short stub of a meeting, due to low attendance.

## CLDR/LDML 48

We agreed on punting the following issues past LDML 48:

- \#936 Add short timezone identifiers  
- \#961 Don't include a time zone option, or be strict if you do  
- \#976 u:locale may be problematic for ICU4X and interoperability  
- \#1005 Test checking the markup arguments  
- \#1032 Specify what kind of user  
- \#1079 :unit needs to support data slicing  
- \#1082 Syntax for semantic datetime field sets and options

The spec as it currently is in the repo is effectively the LDML 48 spec, with the only possible exception of including a draft :percent function (\#956 Please move style percent to its own function). To be included, that will need to land at latest on 2025-08-18.
