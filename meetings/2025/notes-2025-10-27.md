## Updates from Implementers

TIM: No updates on ICU4C.

EAO: Intend to update JS later this week.

## DOM Localization

[https://github.com/w3c/tpac2025-breakouts/issues/67](https://github.com/w3c/tpac2025-breakouts/issues/67)

EAO: Please take look, see also the explainer from breakout session. This is rather direct follow-up from work here on MF2.

## Advancing Drafts

### u:locale

EAO: This is optional as well as draft, but maybe it should be dropped completely, as requested by ICU4X – the use cases are likely to be pretty rare.

### :datetime, :date, :time

EAO: These are blocked on semantic skeletons not being final yet.

TIM: SFC has also some additional concerns.

### :currency

EAO: This could be ready.

TIM: I don’t see any issues about this.

### :percent

EAO: This might also be ready for final?

### :unit

EAO: This is definitely not yet ready; there are a number of open conversations about this.
