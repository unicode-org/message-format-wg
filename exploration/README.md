## MessageFormat 2 Design Documents

This folder contains design documents used by the MessageFormat Working Group
as part of the development process for MFv2.
Designs can be "accepted", "proposed", "rejected", or "obsolete".
These documents are not a normative part of the specification.
They might be helpful to users seeking to understand specific design decisions
taken by the working group,
including which options were considered.

This folder also contains the [design document template](./TEMPLATE.md)
to be used when creating a new design proposal.
